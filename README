About pkg_replace

"pkg_replace" is written by Securedog <securedog@users.sourceforge.jp>.
Thanks to Securedog.

pkg_replace is compatible "portupgrade", and shell script in FreeBSD.
However, this software has not been maintaiend for long time. So, I
have modified pkg_replace to work with the pkgng.

Bugs of this software, The abilities to add, etc., please report to
"Ken DEGUCHI <kdeguchi@sz.tokoha-u.ac.jp>".
